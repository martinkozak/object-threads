FIFO Cache
==========

**Object Threads** emulates Python threading API paradigm. Creating
threads by giving some block to constructor is sometime slightly 
unpractical way of running threads. This library allows encapsulating 
threads to classes, so class can define itself as thread which can be 
run by plain method call. 

For example:

    require "thread/object"

    class Foo
        include Thread::Object
        
        def run
            sleep 10
            puts "Something in thread."
        end
    end
    
    Foo::new.start!
    sleep 5
    
    puts "Something in main."
    
Will print out `"Something in main."` and then `"Something in thread."`.

Thread object module directly supports `#alive?` and `#shutdown!` 
methods only for thread manipulation. For other operations with the 
thread, call directly its `#native_thread` property which contains 
appropriate native [Ruby Thread][1] class. It's for avoiding potential
method name conflicts between module and user class.
